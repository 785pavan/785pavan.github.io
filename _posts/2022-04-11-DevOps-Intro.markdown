**This is my progress of learning and documenting DevOps from scratch.**

If you have read my [about page](https://kandapagari.github.io/about) you know that I have a decent proficiency with python and machine learning methods. One thing you would need to know about me is that I love to learn new thing, be it for the fun of it or because I think it might help me get into a better place in my professional life. This is one of those learning journeys I am taking and I am willing to share it with the reader. I always believed from an young age that `best way to learn is by teaching what you learnt`. Goal(/Destination) for this journey to learn DevOps(what/how to) in 90 days.

The main inspiration for this process is a GitHub repository I found while browsing(yes, I was browsing github ðŸ˜…) called [90DaysOfDevOps](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps). These are my thoughts and notes from this content if needed please go to the original source by [Michael Cade](https://github.com/MichaelCade).

let us start with the most import question of all: **What is DevOps?**

DevOps is a clip-compound word by mixing *Development* and *Operations*, as in Development team and Operations team.
> DevOps = Development + Operations

While we are at it we shall also learn what DevOps is not:

* DevOps is not tool or a technology
* DevOps is not a software that you can learn
* DevOps is not a programing language

Now that negation is out of the way let's answer the first question:

DevOps is a philosophy, DevOps is a mind set of production transforming an idea into a product at millions(ideally) of people can use it. DevOps is a concepts used in the application lifecycle management to ensure a synergy between development team (who write/test the actual code) and operations team (who maintained servers and infrastructure) so that the end product can be delivered smoothly.

**DevOps: Problem statement**
When the product or service that you are providing is medium to big scale, different teams are employed to solve different aspects of the problem, these can be put into two teams

1. Development team(Dev Team)
2. Operations team(Ops Team)

The DevTeam handle writing code, designing new features, testing the features etc., where as OpsTeam help with managing servers, scaling issues, bandwidth, security, backups etc.,

These two teams need to work perfectly in sync with each other for the successful deployment of a product, which is easier said than done. In order to avoid a lag between the team and to deliver the product, a mind set is followed called DevOps. In this philosophy, the two teams are in the sat together where they discuss the strategies for development and deployment and solve the issues together.

Alright that a lot of word vomit
> TL;DR DevOps is a mindset used for bringing development and operations teams together so that product is delivered optimally

Next steps in learning DevOps is learning basics of linux command line. Reasoning for this abrupt and devastations decision (for some) is number of tools available for a particular operating systems and linux wins that race by a landslide. But no need to worry I will be back next time with the wisdom I am able to scrap together and share with you all.

Until Next time -- stay foxy and much love.
